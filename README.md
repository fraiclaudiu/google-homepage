Hello everyone! This is my first project of any kind in the programming world. I can't wait to make it and learn new things throughout the process. I really want to see if I can get it done with the least amount of help possible. It is going to be a challenge! Let's do it!


I've just completed my first project and it feels awesome! I learned how grid and flexbox work and how html and css work together, I had a few problems, but I've managed to find a solution and make it work. I can't wait to start the next project! :D
